# JetsProject

# Description:
This project is a Java-based Jet Fleet Management Application. It allows users to manage a fleet of jets with various capabilities,
such as passenger jets, cargo planes, and fighter jets. The application provides a user-friendly menu interface for performing
actions like listing the fleet, flying jets, viewing the fastest and longest-range jets, loading cargo for cargo planes, and 
initiating dogfights for fighter jets. Users can also add custom jets to the fleet and remove jets as needed. The program continues
until the user selects the "Quit" option.

# Technologies Used:
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming
- File Input/Output
- User Interface Design

# Lessons Learned:
This project has helped to reinforce Java programming concepts, including inheritance, interfaces, and working with collections.
Additionally, it has provided hands-on experience in creating a menu-driven console application and handling file operations for data storage.
