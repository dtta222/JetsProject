//  Purpose: Jet Fleet Management Application
//
//  Description:
//  This Java application allows users to manage a fleet of jets with various capabilities. 
//  It provides a menu-driven interface to list the fleet, perform actions like flying jets,
//  viewing the fastest and longest-range jets, loading cargo for cargo planes, 
//  and initiating dogfights for fighter jets. Users can also add custom jets to the fleet 
//  and remove jets from the fleet. The program continues until the user selects the "Quit" option.

    // This interface represents the ability to engage in combat, and it requires
    // implementing classes to provide a method for combat-related actions.
    public void fight();
}
